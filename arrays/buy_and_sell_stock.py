# 5.6 Buy and sell a stock once
# https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
# Example 1:
# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

# Example 2:
# Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

# ele:
# the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), where n is the length of the array

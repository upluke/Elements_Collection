# We can sort such arrays more efficiently with the help of Heap data structure. Following is the detailed process that uses Heap.
# 1) Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with first k+1 elements. This will take O(k) time (See this GFact)
# 2) One by one remove min element from heap, put it in result array, and add a new element to heap from remaining elements.
# Removing an element and adding a new element to min heap will take log k time. So overall complexity will be O(k) + O((n-k) * log(k)).
# The Min Heap based method takes O(k) + O((m) * log(k)) time where m = n â€“ k and uses O(k) auxiliary space.


# # Given an array of size n, where every
# # element is k away from its target
# # position, sorts the array in O(nLogk) time.
